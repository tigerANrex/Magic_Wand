# Magic_Wand
I made this to automate my time card entry.

We used [Wand](https://prowand.pro-unlimited.com) to enter our time cards.

I used this script with Windows Task Scheduler, so every Friday at 5pm it would run this script.

# Installation
* Python 3
* Selenium 
  ```
  pip install selenium
  ```
  ---or---
  ```
  pip3 install selenium
  ```
* Chrome Webdriver in PATH
* Run the script
  ```
  python Magic_Wand.py
  ```
  --or--
  ```
  python3 Magic_Wand.py
  ```
